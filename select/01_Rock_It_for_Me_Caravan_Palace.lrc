[00:08.72] All the bad boys want some brawl, it's tricky
[00:11.47] And girls enjoy, they feel so lucky
[00:13.69] Laughing at weeds running out the door
[00:16.09] Calling their mom when they lick the floor
[00:17.89] Look how those funky monkeys talk and walk in store
[00:20.02] They're lost, sad and brawny like an apple core
[00:22.43] Who can believe that there will be some gore?
[00:24.48] With those wimps like I said before
[00:41.98] 
[00:27.45] It ain't right, babe, no
[00:29.74] It ain't right, no, no
[00:31.90] Mama, don't do that, you know
[00:33.69] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[00:50.19] 
[00:36.42] It ain't right, babe, no
[00:38.68] It ain't right, no, no
[00:40.85] Mama, don't do that you know
[00:42.82] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[00:59.32] 
[01:03.21] Bad boys are not so picky
[01:05.62] They ride away and feel so happy
[01:07.89] To fight for girls they do adore
[01:10.17] Snorting like boars rolling on the floor
[01:12.05] With their leather jacket and their rocky voice
[01:14.44] They hit, fight, kick, wreak havoc and rejoice
[01:16.91] Nobody knows what they're looking for
[01:19.05] A kind of battle axe or maybe more
[01:36.05] 
[01:21.70] It ain't right, babe, no
[01:23.88] It ain't right, no, no
[01:26.26] Mama, don't do that, you know
[01:27.98] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[01:44.48] 
[01:30.84] It ain't right, babe, no
[01:33.18] It ain't right, no, no
[01:35.22] Mama, don't do that, you know
[01:37.05] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[01:53.55] 
[01:48.56] When a bad boy tramp sounds, it's freaky
[01:51.01] 'Cause you're afraid, remember he's lanky
[01:53.35] Don't rate him, even he gets sore
[01:55.45] Cross the river and roam the shore
[02:12.45] 
[02:16.23] It ain't right, babe, no
[02:18.28] It ain't right, no, no
[02:20.45] Mama, don't do that, you know
[02:22.49] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[02:38.99] 
[02:25.22] It ain't right, babe, no
[02:27.34] It ain't right, no, no
[02:29.78] Mama, don't do that, you know
[02:31.55] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[02:48.05] 
[02:34.13] It ain't right, babe, no
[02:36.23] It ain't right, no, no
[02:38.58] Mama, don't do that, you know
[02:40.55] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
[02:57.05] 
[02:43.35] It ain't right, babe, no
[02:45.57] It ain't right, no, no
[02:47.72] Mama, don't do that, you know
[02:49.51] It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
